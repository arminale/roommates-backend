# roommates-backend

If you've ever lived with roommates you know the hassle of keeping track of shared expenses and making sure everyone pays their fair share. Roommates is a service that'll allow you to centralize all your shared expenses, setup reocurring items, calculate net balance and more! It will also allow you to pay your roommate within the platform.

This repo will be the backend service for this application, powered by Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. Look out for the frontend (using React.js & Redux) and mobile (using react native).
